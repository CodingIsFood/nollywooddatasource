# Nollywood API

Nollywood API is a fully-featured content management platform and API for Nigerian films. Built with Next.js and powered by Contentful headless CMS, this application provides both a comprehensive RESTful API for querying film data and a sleek Admin Dashboard for content management.

## Features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or newer recommended)
*   A Contentful Space and environment with the `film` content type configured.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd nollywoodapi
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project and populate it with your Contentful credentials:

```env
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=your_space_id
CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=master
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_delivery_api_token
CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN=your_management_api_token
```

### Running the Application Locally

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) to access the admin dashboard.

## Contentful Content Model

Your Contentful space must contain a content type with the ID `film`. It should contain the following fields:

*   `title` (Symbol)
*   `releaseYear` (Integer)
*   `description` (Text)
*   `productionCompany` (Symbol)
*   `directedBy` (Symbol)
*   `producedBy` (Symbol)
*   `cast` (List of Symbols / Text)
*   `posterUrl` (Symbol)

*(Note: There is a local script `update_contentful.mjs` available to programmatically push new fields like `directedBy` and `producedBy` to your environment if they are missing).*

## API Reference

The application exposes Next.js Route Handlers to interact with the film database.
